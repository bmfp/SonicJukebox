    With <b>Sonic Jukebox</b> you can easily stream or download music from your home computer to your Android phone using
    the Subsonic media streamer. The Subsonic server software requires additional configuration separate from Sonic Jukebox. For more information or to
    install the Subsonic server software on your computer, please visit <a href="http://subsonic.org">subsonic.org</a>. The basic version of Subsonic is free. 
    When you first install Subsonic, the premium features are available for 30 days so you can try them out before deciding to upgrade.
    Click <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/premium.jsp">here</a> to upgrade to Subsonic Premium. 
</p>

<p>
    By default, Sonic Jukebox is not configured. Once you've set up your own server, please go to <b>Settings</b> and change the configuration
    so that it connects to your own computer.
